# Code Module

Task planning and execution system with pluggable AI harnesses (`@openade/harness`). Supports multiple execution engines (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) through a unified interface. Users describe tasks, the AI generates plans, users can review/revise before execution.

This is a TypeScript-first codebase. When fixing type errors, focus on proper TypeScript solutions rather than workarounds.


## Tray System

Slide-out panels (Files, Search, Changes, Terminal, Processes) managed by `TrayManager`. Each tray type is defined declaratively in `components/tray/trayConfigs.tsx`.

Diff rendering uses `@pierre/diffs` under `components/FilesAndDiffs.tsx`, with `DiffsWorkerProvider` mounted at the code-app root so syntax highlighting runs off the main thread. The Changes tray must stay on the lightweight `getGitSummary()` path until a specific file is selected.

### Adding a New Tray

Add to `TRAY_CONFIGS` array in `trayConfigs.tsx`:

```typescript
{
    id: "mytray",
    label: "My Tray",
    icon: SomeIcon,
    shortcut: { key: "mod+m", display: "⌘M" }, // optional
    renderBadge: (tray) => {
        // Return count/badge content or null
        return count > 0 ? count : null
    },
    renderContent: (tray) => {
        // Return tray panel JSX
        return <MyTrayContent taskId={tray.taskId} onClose={() => tray.close()} />
    },
}
```

Also add to `TrayType` union in `store/managers/TrayManager.ts`.

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `store/managers/TrayManager.ts` | MobX state for open/close |
| `components/tray/trayConfigs.tsx` | Declarative tray definitions |
| `components/tray/TrayButtons.tsx` | Renders toggle buttons from config |
| `components/tray/TraySlideOut.tsx` | Slide-out animation wrapper |

## Backwards Compatibility

**This is a production app with real user data.** Existing tasks, workspaces, persisted events, and storage state must continue to work after code changes. When changing data models or storage schemas:

- Write tolerant readers that handle both old and new shapes (see `harnessEventCompat.ts` for the pattern)
- Use `??` fallbacks for fields that may be absent in old persisted data (e.g. `event.execution.harnessId ?? "claude-code"`)
- Never rename or remove persisted fields without a compat layer
- Test with fixtures that represent old data shapes

## Code Style

- **No JSDoc comments** - Code should be self-documenting
- **No trivial getters** - Inline `task.status === "stopped"` instead of `task.isStopped`
- **Destructured params for 3+ args** - Use inline destructured params
- **Remove unused methods** - After refactors, grep and clean up
- **No string-containment tests on prompts** — `expect(prompt).toContain("some phrase")` tests are brittle, break on every wording change, and verify nothing meaningful. Test prompt builder *logic* (conditional inclusion, merging, undefined returns) not prompt *text*.

## Architecture

```
Routes.tsx          → Thin URL resolution, redirects to pages
CodeLayout.tsx      → Shared layout, sidebar, reconnection logic
pages/*.tsx         → Page components (TaskPage, TaskCreatePage, etc.)
store/              → MobX state management (runtime)
persistence/        → YJS-backed sync (RepoStore, TaskStore)
electronAPI/        → Runtime/Electron host wrappers for renderer callers
components/         → UI components
routing.ts          → Local typesafe routing (isolated from @/state/routing)
api.ts              → Data types, localStorage CRUD
prompts/            → Prompt builders and serialization helpers
```

### Route/Page Separation

Routes resolve URLs and load data. Pages render UI. Routes are in `Routes.tsx`, pages in `pages/`.

### Local Routing

The code module has its own routing in `routing.ts`, isolated from `@/state/routing`. Use `useCodeNavigate()` for navigation:

```typescript
import { useCodeNavigate } from "../routing"

const navigate = useCodeNavigate()
navigate.go("CodeWorkspaceTask", { workspaceId, taskId })
navigate.path("CodeWorkspace", { workspaceId }) // returns URL string
```

For non-React contexts (e.g., NotificationManager), use `CodeStoreConfig.navigateToTask` callback instead.

### Store Structure

Nested managers pattern. Access via `codeStore.{manager}.{method}()`:

```
codeStore
├── repos      # Repo CRUD, RepoEnvironment cache
├── tasks      # Task CRUD, TaskModel cache
├── events     # Event operations
├── execution  # Claude execution, fires after-event hooks
├── comments   # Comment CRUD, consumption tracking
├── queries    # Active query tracking, abort
└── ...
```

Key observable wrappers:
- `TaskModel` - Per-task state, environment, input manager
- `EventModel` - Per-event derived state

### Runtime And Electron Host Access

Dashboard (`electronAPI/`) ↔ local runtime bridge/Electron host modules

**All host APIs used in the code module must go through `electronAPI/`.** Prefer local runtime methods for plain request/response host operations. Use direct Electron IPC only for narrow OS/window integrations such as file dialogs, URL opening, window frame controls, and notifications.

Main modules: runtime (agent/process/PTY/git/files transport), shell (directory picker, open URL), procs (typed read/edit/save for `openade.toml`)

Task execution goes through the OpenADE runtime module (`openade/turn/start`, `openade/review/start`, `openade/turn/interrupt`). Durable repo/task/comment/task-metadata mutations should also use `runtime/localOpenADEClient.ts` (`openade/repo/*`, `openade/task/*`, `openade/comment/*`) and then refresh from storage or runtime notifications. Use `getHarnessQueryManager()` only for low-level harness helpers that are not task turns, such as small JSON-constrained helpers (cron generation, config suggestions).

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Create** - User enters description, selects branch, chooses isolation strategy
2. **Setup** - Worktree created (if worktree mode), setup script runs
3. **Plan/Do** - Claude generates plan or executes directly
4. **Revise** - User leaves inline comments, Claude updates plan
5. **Execute** - Approved plan runs

## Isolation Strategies

Set at task creation, immutable:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `worktree` | Isolated git worktree from source branch |
| `head` | Work directly in repo, no isolation |

## Event Types

| Type | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| `action` | LLM execution (plan/revise/review/do/ask/run_plan) |
| `setup_environment` | Worktree setup completed |
| `snapshot` | Frozen code state after action |

## Input Commands

`InputManager` computes available commands based on task state:

- **Stop** - Abort the current task execution (single-query and HyperPlan multi-agent runs)
- **Plan** - Generate new plan
- **Revise** - Update plan with feedback
- **Review Plan** - Launch external read-only review of the active plan (harness/model picker), then auto-handoff notes back to main thread
- **Run Plan** - Execute approved plan
- **Do** - Direct execution
- **Repeat** - Repeatedly sends the same prompt until stopped; optional stop-on-text halts on match
- **Ask** - Read-only exploration
- **Review** - Launch external read-only review of recent work (when no active plan), then auto-handoff notes back to main thread
- Review follow-up handoffs should require a `Criticality: N/10` score for each finding so users can judge whether the fix is worth the engineering effort
- Review events may persist the generated reviewer instructions on `source.userInstructions` so the exact prompt can be copied from the event log
- **Commit & Push** - Git commit (if needed) and push in one flow (accepts optional additional commit instructions from the editor)

## Comment System

Users leave inline comments on plans, diffs, code. Comments are "consumed" when sent to Claude:

1. Pending comments are editable
2. On action, pending comments included in prompt
3. `ActionEvent.includesCommentIds` tracks what was sent
4. Consumed comments become read-only

## Design System

**Philosophy: Flat, square, clean, spacious.** No rounded corners.

**IMPORTANT: All `<button>` elements must include the `btn` class.** The code module uses a low-specificity CSS reset (`.btn { all: unset }` in `tw.css`) to clear inherited browser/dashboard button styles. Without `btn`, buttons may render with unexpected padding, borders, or backgrounds.

**IMPORTANT: Always read `tw.css` before working with colors.** The code module has its own standalone theme system. Only use color tokens defined in `tw.css`. Never use legacy color tokens from the dashboard's `src/tw.css` or any other color system unless explicitly asked.

### Theme System

The code module supports multiple themes: `code-theme-light`, `code-theme-dark`, `code-theme-black`, `code-theme-synthwave` (applied in `CodeAppLayout.tsx`). Theme selection is managed via Settings → Vibes tab.

Key rule: `bg-{color}` pairs with `text-{color}-content`.

**Adding a new theme requires:**
1. Add CSS class in `tw.css` with `--editor-theme` and `--terminal-theme` variables
2. Register in `persistence/personalSettingsStore.ts`
3. (Optional) Add new terminal palette in `themes/terminalThemes.ts` if existing ones don't match

See `_docs/design.md` → "Adding a New Theme" for details.

**Portal elements** (dropdowns, modals, popups) must use `usePortalContainer()` hook to render inside the themed container:

```tsx
import { usePortalContainer } from "../hooks/usePortalContainer"

const portalContainer = usePortalContainer()
<SelectBase.Portal container={portalContainer}>...</SelectBase.Portal>
```

See `_docs/design.md` for full patterns and `tw.css` for color definitions.

## Data Folder (Unified Storage)

Files are stored at `~/.openade/data/{folder}/{id}.{ext}` through trusted local runtime methods:
- `data/file/save` — atomic write (temp+rename)
- `data/file/load` — returns base64 payload or null through the runtime wrapper
- `data/file/delete` — best-effort unlink

Allowed folders: `images`, `snapshots`, `cron`. Web side uses `dataFolderApi` from `electronAPI/dataFolder.ts` for generic blobs. Snapshot diffs use trusted runtime methods in `electronAPI/snapshots.ts` that store `{id}.patch` plus `{id}.json`, load the index first, and range-read only the selected file slice.

### Image Attachments

Users can paste images (Cmd+V) or click the attach button. Flow:
1. **Capture**: Paste handler or file input → `processImageBlob()` in `utils/imageAttachment.ts`
2. **Resize**: `resizeImage()` constrains to 1568px max dimension / 1.15MP (configurable in `IMAGE_CONSTRAINTS`)
3. **Store**: Original saved to `~/.openade/data/images/{ulid}.{ext}`, preview held as in-memory data URL
4. **Submit**: `SmartEditorManager.pendingImages` → `InputManager.captureAndClear()` → `openade-client` → `openade/turn/start`
5. **Prompt**: Runtime host loads stored image files, base64-encodes them, and sends `ContentBlock[]` to the harness provider
6. **Render**: `ActionEvent.images` → `ImageAttachments` component loads from disk, renders thumbnails with lightbox

The `UserInputContext` type bundles `userInput` + `images` and threads from UI through execution to prompt building. `PromptBuildContext` extends it with `comments`.

## Settings & Environment Variables

User settings managed via Settings modal (accessed from sidebar). Uses YJS persistence (`PersonalSettingsStore`).

### Environment Variables

Custom env vars automatically propagate to **all Electron subprocess calls**:
- Terminal PTYs (`pty.ts`)
- Process handles (`process.ts`)
- Git operations (`git.ts`)
- File search (`files.ts`)
- Binary checks (`platform.ts`)

**How it works:**

1. User configures env vars in Settings modal
2. `CodeStore.initializeStores()` pushes env vars to Electron through trusted runtime method `host/subprocess/setGlobalEnv`
3. MobX reaction pushes updates whenever env vars change
4. Electron's `subprocess.ts` caches env vars and merges them into all subprocess calls

**No manual env var passing needed on dashboard side.** Electron modules automatically include global env vars. The merge order is:
- `process.env` (system)
- `globalEnvVars` (user settings from Settings modal)
- `params.env` (call-specific, for future use)

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `persistence/personalSettingsStore.ts` | YJS store for personal settings |
| `persistence/personalSettingsStoreBootstrap.ts` | Store connection setup |
| `components/settings/SettingsModal.tsx` | Settings modal with sidebar tabs |
| `components/settings/SystemConfigTab.tsx` | Binary status, env vars editor |
| `electronAPI/subprocess.ts` | Global env vars push through local runtime |

## MCP Connectors

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude's capabilities. Managed via `ConnectorsPage` and `TaskMcpSelector`.

MCP test/OAuth operations go through trusted runtime methods in `electronAPI/mcp.ts`; OAuth completion is delivered by runtime notification `host/mcp/oauthComplete`.

### Presets

Presets are defined in `constants.ts` with `simple-icons` for brand icons:

```typescript
import { siNotion } from "simple-icons"

export const MCP_PRESETS = {
    notion: {
        id: "notion",
        name: "Notion",
        description: "Access pages, databases, and workspace content",
        transportType: "http",
        url: "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp",
        icon: siNotion,
    },
    // ...
}
```

To add a preset:
1. Find the icon at https://simpleicons.org
2. Import it: `import { siIconname } from "simple-icons"`
3. Add the preset with verified URL

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ConnectorsPage` | Global connector management (install/remove/connect) |
| `TaskMcpSelector` | Per-task connector selection (compact chips) |
| `McpServerIcon` | Renders brand icon or fallback Globe/Terminal |
| `AddMcpServerModal` | Custom server configuration form |

### Local UI Components

The code module has its own Modal components in `components/ui/`:
- `Modal` - Base modal with flat, square design
- `ModalConfirm` - Confirmation dialog for destructive actions

Import from `../components/ui` not `@/funktionalChat/components`.

| Terminal themes | `themes/terminalThemes.ts` |
| Terminal theme hook | `hooks/useTerminalTheme.ts` |

HyperPlan planning can pass serialized main-thread context to sub-planners using `prompts/taskThreadSerializer.ts`.
HyperPlan execution is server-owned through the OpenADE runtime module. The renderer may define/select strategies and display persisted sub-executions, but it must not reintroduce a renderer-owned HyperPlan executor or direct harness orchestration path.
This context is capped by UTF-8 byte budget (default `240_000`) and includes the newest events that fit.

Model version bumps should be made in `projects/harness/src/models.ts`. Web pickers and execution helpers read from that shared catalog, so avoid hardcoding new model versions in web components.

## MobX Patterns

### Disposer Pattern

Classes with subscriptions store disposers:

```typescript
class TaskModel {
    private disposers: Array<() => void> = []

    constructor() {
        this.disposers.push(
            this.store.execution.onAfterEvent((id) => { ... })
        )
    }

    dispose(): void {
        for (const d of this.disposers) d()
        this.disposers = []
    }
}
```

Call `TaskManager.invalidateTaskModel(taskId)` when task changes significantly.

### Event Hooks

ExecutionManager only broadcasts after-event notifications now. Server-owned runtime notifications refresh Yjs task state and call `onAfterEvent()` subscribers when a task leaves the working set.
